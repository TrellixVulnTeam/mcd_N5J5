Deep Learning for Image and Video
---

Two assignments have been done:

- **Image classification** using **convolutional neural networks** (Folder [P1](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/VIDEO/P1))
- **Video classification** using simple techniques such as random assignation or CNN with spatiotemporal pooling (Folder [P2](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/VIDEO/P2))
