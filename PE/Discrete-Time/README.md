Discrete Time Stochastic Processes
---

Two assignments have been done for this part of the subject:

- The first one was about **discrete time Markov Chains (DTMC)** and simple properties of them (Folder [E1](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/PE/Discrete-Time/E1))
- The second one was about the **Gambler's ruin** problem and **dynamical systems** (Folder [E2](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/PE/Discrete-Time/E2))
