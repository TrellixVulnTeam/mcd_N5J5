Information Theory 
---

In this subject, some proofs of basic properties of Entropy and Mutual information were done (Folder [Ejercicios](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/TI/Ejercicios)).

Also, a quite extense assigment about **signal preprocessing** (signal window study) and study of **Entropy, Relative Entropy and Mutual Information** between signals (Folder [mcd-ti](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-ti/tree/d7b533ccf8baa4a33e561029034c766198006c8d))
