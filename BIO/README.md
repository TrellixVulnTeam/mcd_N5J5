Deep Learning for Biometric signals
---

Three assignments have been done:

- **Fingerptint recognition** using the **minutiaes** of the fingerprint (Folder [Fingerprint](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/BIO/Fingerprint))
- **Face recognition** using general machine learning algorithms and dimensionality reduction over the face images (Folder [FaceRecognition](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/BIO/FaceRecognition))
- **Signature recognition** using extracted and handcrafted features obtained from the sensors (Folder [SignatureRecognition](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/BIO/SignatureRecognition))
