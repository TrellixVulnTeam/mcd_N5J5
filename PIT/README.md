Temporal Information Processing

Three assignments have been done:

- **Classic models for time series**, such as **AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA** were fitted to different time series (Folder [P1](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/PIT/P1))
- **Hidden Markov Models** were defined and fitted for certain data in the second assignment (Folder [P2](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/PIT/P2))
- **LSTMS** were defined and trained in the third assignment (Folder [P3](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd/tree/main/PIT/P3))
